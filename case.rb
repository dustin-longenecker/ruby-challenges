#    Create a variable that will hold the weather. Just to make things easier, the weather should be limited to a single word: sunny, cloudy, foggy, rainy, etc.
#    Start your case statement with the keyword case followed by your variable.
#    Next, use the when keyword to check a string that the weather variable could be equal to, followed by a puts line that gives advice about what to wear.
#    Create as many when / puts lines as you need to check for all kinds of weather.
#    Donâ€™t forget to close your case statement with the end keyword.
